# Tasks for the LumoSQL Documentation Project

* Resolve conflicts between lumodoc:doctext/lumo-quickstart.md and lumosql:README.md . They
  started life as the same document some time ago
* Sort out ToCs. Using bin/gh and manually inserting isn't a great solution
* Replace using-git-and-github.md with a much smaller Fossil doc
* Improve the Makefile, and make it push generated HTML pages to lumosql.org:/home/lumosqlorg/
* Adopt Pictchr, in doc/README.md and then the actual diagrams
* Write up privacy and GDPR
* Makefile to generate HTML for front page of lumosql.org and push it there
* Write up the btree.h refactored at https://sqlite.org/src/info/c16c855f7e2ef5bf

<!-- from virtual-machine.md -->
This new architecture means:

1. Features such as WALs or paging or network paging etc are specific to the backend, and invisible to any other LumoSQL or SQLite code.
2. Bug-for-bug compatibility with the original SQLite btree.c can be maintained (except in the case of encryption, which no open source users have access to anyway.)
3. New backends with novel features (and LMDB is novel enough, for a first example!) can be introduced without disturbing other code, and being able to be benchmarked and tested safely.

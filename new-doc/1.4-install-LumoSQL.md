# Building and Installing LumoSQL

## Directory layout

In order to build LumoSQL and SQLite and to used different versions of the backends,
we use the following directory layout:

... FIXME update for a not-forking world...

[Build and test LumoSQL](./3.5-lumo-test-build.md)

## Linux/Unix


### Build environment

On Ubuntu 18.0.4 LTS, Debian Stable (buster), and on any reasonably recent
Debian or Ubuntu-derived distribution, you need only:

```sh
sudo apt install git build-essential tcl
sudo apt build-dep sqlite3
```

(`apt build-dep` requires `deb-src` lines uncommented in /etc/apt/sources.list).

On Fedora 30, and on any reasonably recent Fedora-derived distribution:

```sh
sudo dnf install --assumeyes \
  git make gcc ncurses-devel readline-devel glibc-devel autoconf tcl-devel
```

The maintainers test building LumoSQL on Debian, Fedora, Gentoo and Ubuntu.
Container images with the dependencies installed are available at
<https://quay.io/repository/keith_maxwell/lumosql-build> and the build steps are
in <https://github.com/maxwell-k/containers>.

### Using the Makefile tool

*FIXME for a post-not-forking world*

# Running LumoSQL

libraries and a command line shell are built with the following names:

    ```lumosql```

    This is the command line shell. It operates identically to the SQLite sqlite3 shell.

    ```liblumosql```

    This is the library that provides the LumoSQL SQL interface. It is the equivalent of the SQLite libsqlite3 library.

## Windows

LumoSQL is not supported on Windows as yet. Want to help?

## Android

LumoSQL is not supported on Android as yet.  Want to help?

# Speed tests / benchmarking

To benchmark a single binary takes approximately 4 minutes to complete depending
on hardware.

The instructions in this section explain how to benchmark four different
versions:

| V.  | SQLite | LMDB   | Repository | Report filename    |
| --- | ------ | ------ | ---------- | ------------------ |
| A.  | 3.7.17 | -      | SQLite     | SQLite-3.7.17.html |
| B.  | 3.30.1 | -      | SQLite     | SQLite-3.30.1.html |
| C.  | 3.7.17 | 0.9.9  | LumoSQL    | LMDB_0.9.9.html    |
| D.  | 3.7.17 | 0.9.16 | LumoSQL    | LMDB_0.9.16.html   |

To benchmark the four versions above use:

```sh
make benchmark
```

The "Repository" column means:

<dl>
<dt>SQLite</dt>
<dd>

<https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite>

</dd>
<dt>LumoSQL</dt>
<dd>

<https://github.com/LumoSQL/LumoSQL> (this repository)

</dd>
</dl>

# Which LMDB version?

`mc_orig` was removed and `mc_backup` added to `mdb.c` in
<https://github.com/LMDB/lmdb/commit/be47ca766713f55e5b3abd18120514fdad7d90f2>
first released in `LMDB_0.9.7` on 14 August 2013. `LMDB_0.9.8` was 9 September
2013 and `LMDB_0.9.9` was 24 October 2013.
<https://github.com/LMDB/sqlightning/commit/58b473f3d5570fca94b88398e0e4314208a077cd>
adapted `sqlightning` to this change on 12 September 2013. So first try
`LMDB_0.9.8`, but this fails with:
`sqlite3.c:38156:2: error: unknown type name ‘mdb_hash_t’`.

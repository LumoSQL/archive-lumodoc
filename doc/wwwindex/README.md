# www index: root page for lumosql.org

The three LumoSQL projects each have a home page that is presented by Fossil
and stored doc/README.md for each project. The root page of the website is not
presented by Fossil, and so needs to be maintained separately.

For the moment it is an HTML document called index.html generated by Pandoc from index.md .

Process:

<code>
  sh ./make-index
  $web-brower ./index.html      # test locally
  scp index.html pandoc.css  lumosql.example.org
</code>

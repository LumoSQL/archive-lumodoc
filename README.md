# Lumodoc, the LumoSQL Documentation Project

This is the project that maintains the documentation for
[LumoSQL](https://lumosql.org/src/lumosql). LumoSQL enhances the
[SQLite](https://sqlite.org) database library 
[without forking it](https://lumosql.org/src/not-forking).

Lumodoc is a [Science Communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_communication) project,
whereas LumoSQL is a software engineering project to create a new kind of database.

LumoSQL and any other project wanting to link to the LumoSQL docs need to point at the 
"doc" directory within this project, using this URL: 
[https://lumosql.org/doc](https://lumosql.org/doc). That is the finished product.
This README.md document you are reading is part of the Lumodoc project, not the finished product
Lumodoc produces, and it is kept at
[https://lumosql.org/src/lumodoc/](https://lumosql.org/src/lumodoc/) . The documentation
for the Lumodoc project is at [https://lumosql.org/src/docdoc](https://lumosql.org/src/docdoc).

## Version Control and Website

Lumodoc sources and the official website are managed using the [Fossil](https://www.fossil-scm.org/) [SCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/Source_control_management). If you are reading this on Github 
or anywhere other than <tt>lumosql.org</tt> then you are looking at a read-only mirror.

## Contributing

Drop in to the [Lumodoc forum](https://lumosql.org/src/lumodoc/forum) and post a message
about what you think needs done. You can tell us about corrections to the documentation,
or contribute anything else you wish, noting that the forum understands the Markdown format.
If you want to get more serious we recommend you 
[download Fossil or build it](https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/build.wiki) on your 
local computer.

# Technical Implementation

The URL https://lumosql.org/doc is an Apache webserver alias pointing to the Fossil repository
directory [https://lumosql.org/src/lumodoc/doc](https://lumosql.org/src/lumodoc/doc). 
Fossil serves up the current version of the requested file, processing all markup according to 
[Fossil's Markdown rules](https://fossil-scm.org/home/md_rules), and generating HTML. The
HTML is then served by Apache just as if it was contained in my-webpage.html .

With the Markdown text, diagrams are specified using 
[Pikchr](https://pikchr.org/home/doc/trunk/doc/examples.md), a plain text format that generates SVG.

In a near-future version of the Lumodoc project it is almost inevitable that we will change this
workflow to include the amazing [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) document convertor. The first step
to using Pandoc would be to have it process the Markdown files and generate new Markdown files
that include a table of contents (all ToCs are currently generated by a tool and imported manually.)
Pandoc can convert from Markdown to PDF and HTML, so there are many other eventual possibilities.

## Really Why a Separate Project?

In more detail... while there are a few very code-specific technical documents
included in the main LumoSQL project, everything else is here because:

* Document management tools, scripts and work-in-progress notes are nothing to do with a production database system and shouldn't be mixed up with it
* Other output formats such as a website(s) or a book are even further from a production database
* Documentation often has a very different release cycle and management process than code
* Bugs, fixes and complaints to documentation shouldn't generally be mixed up with code problems
* Everthing in LumoSQL is under [one single code-specific licence](https://lumosql.org/src/lumosql/LICENCES/README.md) , whereas here in Lumodoc we mainly use [a documentation-specific licence](LICENCES/README.md).

Co-incidentally, 
[SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docsrc/doc/trunk/README.md) is also
managed in a separate repository. This is one of many examples where the
LumoSQL project is somewhat similar to SQLite.
